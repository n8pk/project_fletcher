# Recs on Recs
#### a marijuana recommendation engine using NLP
---
The requirements for this project were to use unsupervised learning and natural language processing techniques on text data. Additionally, all data was to be stored in a Mongo database.

## Project Motivation
---
My intent with this project was to provide a starting point for building out a recommender system for retail marijuana. Due to project requirements, I limited the scope to using reviews (text only) of popular strains in order to determine what strains are most similar. 

## Findings
---
Within the most recent reviews (~100 each) of some of the most popular strains listed on [leafly.com](https://www.leafly.com/explore), I found 4 general topics:
1. Daytime use, helps with anxeity and depression.
2. Nighttime use, helps with insomnia.
3. Relaxation, helps with nerve pain.
4. Uplifting, creativity, helps with chronic pain.
